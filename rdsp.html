			<p>A registered disability savings plan (RDSP) is a trust arrangement that is registered with the Canada Revenue Agency. Its 
				main purpose is to give financial security to an RDSP beneficiary after they turn 60 years of age.</p>
			<br>
			<p>An eligible person or organization can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>open an RDSP for an eligible beneficiary’s benefit with a participating financial institution</li>
				<li>contribute up to $200,000 to the RDSP until the end of the year the beneficiary turns 59 years of age</li>
				<li>apply, on behalf of the beneficiary, for Government of Canada disability savings grant and bond incentives.  
					For details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/disability/savings/how-much.html">
						Canada disability savings grants and bonds</a></li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>All contributions, rollovers, grants, bonds, and investment earnings grow tax-free while they are in an RDSP. Grants, bonds, rollovers, and investment 
				earnings are included in the beneficiary’s income for tax purposes when withdrawn.</p>

			<p>RDSP is tax-sheltered which means you do not pay tax on the money in the plan until it is withdrawn.</p>
